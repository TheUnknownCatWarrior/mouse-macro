# pet-simulator-macros_roblox
A place to find all the macros I made to play the game PSX.
The Pet Simulator GUI is sometimes clunky, especially at the rb/gold/darkMatter machine in the game.

To run this code you'll need to install the latest Python and some libraries. 
DO NOT RUN WITH PYTHON IDLE.
Open up the cmd prompt and enter these commands: pip install pyautogui, pip install keyboard
The program will walk you through how to set up the macro once you run the code.
